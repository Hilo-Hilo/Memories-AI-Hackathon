# GPT-4o-mini

GPT-4o-mini is a cost-optimized variant of GPT-4o, designed for high-efficiency processing while maintaining strong performance. It excels in rapid inference and resource-efficient operations, making it ideal for production deployments requiring a balance of cost and capability.

## Key Features

- **Release Date:** July 18, 2024
- **Max Context Tokens:** 128,000
- **Cost-effective processing**
- **Low latency responses**
- **Efficient resource utilization**
- **Strong performance on common tasks**
- **Reliable output quality**
- **Optimized for production use**
- **Excellent scaling characteristics**

## Vision Capabilities

GPT-4o-mini has strong vision capabilities, but it's important to be aware of its token consumption for image processing. It uses approximately 33x more tokens for an image compared to GPT-4o, while being 33x cheaper per token. This results in a similar cost for vision tasks.

## Pricing

- **Input Cost (per 1M tokens):** $0.150
- **Output Cost (per 1M tokens):** $0.600

## Use Cases

- High-volume production deployments
- Cost-sensitive applications
- Real-time processing needs
- Standard NLP tasks
- Efficient API integrations
- Resource-constrained environments
- Scalable system architectures
