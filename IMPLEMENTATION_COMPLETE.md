# Optimal Focus Duration Recommender - Implementation Complete

## Summary

Successfully implemented a new agentic feature that analyzes your past distraction patterns to recommend optimal focus block durations. This replaces the "close app" feature with something more useful and personalized.

## What Was Implemented

### 1. Core Analysis Engine âœ…
- **File**: `src/focus_guardian/ai/focus_duration_analyzer.py` (NEW)
- Analyzes historical sessions to find first distraction times
- Calculates mean and median statistics
- Recommends 75% of typical first distraction time (configurable)
- Minimum recommended duration: 5 minutes

### 2. Database Enhancements âœ…
- **File**: `src/focus_guardian/core/database.py`
- Added `get_first_distraction_time(session_id)` - gets seconds until first distraction
- Added `get_sessions_with_distractions(limit)` - gets completed sessions with distractions

### 3. Configuration System âœ…
- **Files**: 
  - `config/default_config.json` - Added 4 new config keys
  - `src/focus_guardian/core/config.py` - Added 4 new getter methods
- Settings:
  - `focus_analyzer_enabled`: true
  - `focus_analyzer_min_sessions`: 3
  - `focus_analyzer_lookback_days`: 30
  - `focus_analyzer_recommendation_factor`: 0.75

### 4. Session Manager Integration âœ…
- **File**: `src/focus_guardian/session/session_manager.py`
- Added `focus_analyzer` instance variable
- Initializes analyzer on startup
- Added `get_focus_duration_recommendation()` method for UI

### 5. UI Display âœ…
- **File**: `src/focus_guardian/ui/main_window.py`
- Added `focus_recommendation_label` widget to dashboard
- Added `_update_focus_recommendation()` method
- Displays personalized recommendation message
- Shows automatically when app loads (if sufficient data available)

### 6. Module Exports âœ…
- **File**: `src/focus_guardian/ai/__init__.py`
- Added `FocusDurationAnalyzer` to exports

## How It Works

1. On app startup, queries database for last 30 days of completed sessions
2. For each session with distractions, calculates time until first distraction
3. Computes statistics (mean, median)
4. Recommends: `median_time * 0.75` (75% for safety margin)
5. Displays personalized message in Dashboard tab

## Example Output

```
ðŸ’¡ Based on your past 5 sessions, your typical first distraction 
occurs around 16 minutes. We recommend 12-minute focus blocks to 
maximize your productivity.
```

## What Users Will See

### Dashboard Tab
- A highlighted box with the recommendation (blue left border)
- Visible only when sufficient data exists (3+ sessions)
- Updates automatically as more sessions are completed

### Configuration
- All settings in `config/default_config.json`
- Can disable: `"focus_analyzer_enabled": false`
- Can adjust lookback window, min sessions, safety factor

## Benefits

1. **Replaces problematic feature**: No macOS permissions issues, more reliable
2. **Data-driven**: Based on actual user behavior, not guesswork
3. **Personalized**: Each user gets recommendations based on their patterns
4. **Actionable**: Gives specific time suggestions (e.g., "12 minutes")
5. **Non-intrusive**: Just displays a recommendation, doesn't force behavior
6. **Improves over time**: Gets more accurate as user completes more sessions

## Files Created/Modified

**Created (1 file)**:
- `src/focus_guardian/ai/focus_duration_analyzer.py`
- `FOCUS_DURATION_ANALYZER.md` (documentation)

**Modified (5 files)**:
- `src/focus_guardian/core/database.py`
- `src/focus_guardian/core/config.py`
- `src/focus_guardian/session/session_manager.py`
- `src/focus_guardian/ui/main_window.py`
- `config/default_config.json`
- `src/focus_guardian/ai/__init__.py`

**Total Lines Added**: ~350 lines

## Testing Notes

- Requires at least 3 completed sessions with at least one distraction each
- Check logs for: "Generated focus recommendation: X minutes"
- If no recommendation appears: not enough historical data yet
- Can manually test by running focus sessions and checking recommendations

## Next Steps

To test this feature:
1. Launch the app
2. Complete at least 3 sessions with distractions
3. Look for the recommendation in the Dashboard tab

The recommendation will automatically appear when you have sufficient data!
