# Facial Expression Model

The Facial Expression model analyzes visual data from images and videos to measure emotional expression. It is capable of detecting subtle facial movements and providing a rich, nuanced understanding of how emotions are expressed through the face.

## Dimensions of Expression

The model measures 48 distinct dimensions of emotional meaning, allowing for a detailed analysis of facial expressions. These dimensions go beyond basic emotions to capture a wide range of affective states.

## Capabilities

The Facial Expression model can identify a variety of expressions, including those associated with:

*   Love and admiration
*   Awe and wonder
*   Disappointment and sadness
*   Empathic pain and cringing

## Optional Outputs: FACS 2.0

In addition to the 48 emotional dimensions, the model can optionally provide measurements based on the Facial Action Coding System (FACS). This includes:

*   **Traditional Action Units (AUs)**: Such as "inner brow raise" and "nose crinkle."
*   **Facial Descriptions**: Such as "smile," "wink," "hand over mouth," and "hand over eyes."

This provides a more granular, anatomically-based description of facial movements, which can be useful for a variety of applications.
