# Speech Prosody Model

The Speech Prosody model analyzes the non-linguistic aspects of speech to measure emotional expression. It focuses on the tone, rhythm, and timbre of the voice to understand how something is said, rather than just what is said.

## Dimensions of Expression

The model measures 48 distinct dimensions of emotional meaning, providing a detailed analysis of the emotional content of speech.

## Capabilities

The Speech Prosody model can detect a wide range of emotions and affective states from the way a person speaks. This includes, but is not limited to:

*   Excitement and enthusiasm
*   Sadness and disappointment
*   Anger and frustration
*   Calmness and serenity

By analyzing the prosodic features of speech, the model can provide valuable insights into a speaker's emotional state, even when the linguistic content of their speech is neutral.
