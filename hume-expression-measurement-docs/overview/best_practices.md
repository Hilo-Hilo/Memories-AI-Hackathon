# Best Practices

This document outlines best practices for working with the Hume Expression Measurement API to ensure optimal performance, accuracy, and ethical use.

## Data Quality

The quality of your input data significantly affects the accuracy of emotion predictions. When preparing media for analysis, consider the following guidelines.

For video input, ensure adequate lighting and resolution so that facial features are clearly visible. The face model requires faces to be at least 60 pixels in size by default, though this threshold can be adjusted. Position subjects facing the camera when possible, as profile views may reduce detection accuracy.

For audio input, use clear recordings with minimal background noise. The prosody and burst models work best when the target voice is the dominant sound in the recording. Consider using noise reduction preprocessing if working with noisy environments.

For text input, provide sufficient context for the language model to accurately assess emotional tone. Single words or very short phrases may not contain enough information for reliable analysis.

## Model Selection

Not all models need to be run for every use case. Select only the models that are relevant to your application to reduce processing time and costs.

If you are analyzing text-only content, use only the language model. For voice calls without video, the prosody and burst models are most relevant. For video content, consider whether you need facial analysis, speech analysis, or both.

## Batch Processing

When processing large quantities of media, use the Batch API rather than making individual requests. The Batch API is designed for efficient processing of multiple files and provides better performance for bulk operations.

Group related files into archives when submitting batch jobs. The API can process zip, tar.gz, tar.bz2, and tar.xz archives, which simplifies file management and reduces the number of API calls needed.

## Real-Time Processing

For real-time applications using the WebSocket API, be mindful of network latency and processing time. Send data in appropriately sized chunks to balance between latency and efficiency.

Implement appropriate buffering and error handling to ensure smooth operation even if network conditions vary. Consider fallback strategies for when real-time processing is not possible.

## Interpreting Results

Emotion scores should be interpreted as measures of expression, not as direct indicators of internal emotional states. Multiple emotions can have high scores simultaneously, reflecting the complex nature of human expression.

Always consider the context in which expressions occur. The same facial expression or vocal pattern may have different meanings in different situations. Cultural factors can also influence how emotions are expressed and should be considered when interpreting results.

## Performance Optimization

When using the SDKs, take advantage of asynchronous operations to improve performance. The async clients in both Python and TypeScript allow for concurrent processing of multiple requests.

Configure appropriate timeout values based on your use case. Longer videos will naturally take more time to process, so adjust timeouts accordingly to avoid premature failures.

## Cost Management

Monitor your API usage regularly to avoid unexpected costs. The pricing varies based on input type and duration, so understanding your usage patterns can help optimize costs.

For development and testing, use shorter clips or smaller datasets to minimize costs while validating your implementation. Scale up to full datasets only after confirming that your integration works correctly.

## Security and Privacy

Never expose your API keys in client-side code or public repositories. Use environment variables or secure secret management systems to protect your credentials.

When processing user data, ensure compliance with relevant privacy regulations such as GDPR or HIPAA. Obtain appropriate consent before analyzing emotional expressions, and be transparent about how the data will be used.

Consider data retention policies and implement appropriate deletion mechanisms for processed media and results. Not all applications require long-term storage of emotional analysis data.

## Error Handling

Implement robust error handling in your applications. Network issues, rate limits, and processing errors can all occur, and your application should handle these gracefully.

Use the automatic retry mechanisms provided by the SDKs, but also implement application-level fallbacks for cases where retries are not successful. Log errors appropriately for debugging and monitoring purposes.

## Testing

Test your integration thoroughly with representative samples before deploying to production. Verify that the emotion predictions align with your expectations and that your application handles the results correctly.

Consider edge cases such as media with no detectable faces, silent audio, or ambiguous emotional content. Ensure your application behaves appropriately in these scenarios.
