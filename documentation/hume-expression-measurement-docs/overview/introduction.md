# Introduction to Hume Expression Measurement API

The Hume Expression Measurement API provides a powerful tool for analyzing human emotional expression in various media formats. This document serves as a comprehensive guide for developers and AI agents to understand and utilize the API effectively.

## Core Concepts

The API is built on the principle of providing "emotional intelligence for any application." It aims to measure emotional expression along with language to help developers optimize applications for user happiness and well-being. The API is designed around a unified structure that provides access to multiple modalities of expression analysis through a single interface.

### Key Features

*   **Multi-modal Analysis**: The API can process video, audio, images, and text to provide a holistic view of emotional expression.
*   **High-Dimensional Emotion Model**: Instead of relying on a small set of discrete emotions, Hume's models are based on a high-dimensional, continuous space of emotional expression, allowing for more nuanced and accurate measurements.
*   **Scientifically Grounded**: The models are built on over a decade of research in emotion science and have been trained on vast datasets of human expressions from diverse cultures.
*   **Developer-Friendly**: The API is accessible through both REST and WebSocket interfaces, with SDKs available for popular programming languages to simplify integration.

This documentation will guide you through the various aspects of the API, from the underlying scientific principles to practical implementation details. Whether you are building an application that responds to user emotions in real-time or conducting large-scale analysis of media archives, the Hume Expression Measurement API offers the tools you need to incorporate emotional intelligence into your work.
