# Scientific Background

The Hume Expression Measurement API is grounded in over a decade of scientific research into human emotion and expression. This section provides an overview of the key scientific principles that underpin the API's capabilities.

## High-Dimensional Emotion Model

Traditional theories of emotion often focus on a small number of discrete categories, such as the six basic emotions of happiness, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, and surprise. However, research has shown that human emotional experience is far more complex and nuanced. Hume AI's approach is based on a high-dimensional, continuous model of emotion, which allows for a more accurate and comprehensive understanding of emotional expression.

This model is derived from data-driven analysis of large-scale datasets of human expressions, and it captures the subtle variations and combinations of emotions that are often missed by simpler models. This approach is better suited for understanding the rich and dynamic nature of human emotional life.

## Cross-Cultural Research

Hume AI has conducted extensive research on emotional expression across different cultures. This research has involved collecting and analyzing millions of facial expressions, vocal bursts, and speech samples from people around the world. The findings from this research have been used to train the models that power the Expression Measurement API, ensuring that they are sensitive to cultural variations in emotional expression.

Key research papers that inform the models include:

*   "Deep learning reveals what vocal bursts express in different cultures"
*   "Deep learning reveals what facial expressions mean to people in different cultures"

## Important Considerations

It is crucial to understand that the outputs of the Expression Measurement API are not a direct readout of a person's internal emotional state. The API measures the expression of emotion, which is an outward display that may or may not correspond to a person's subjective feelings. Emotional experience is a complex and multifaceted phenomenon that is influenced by a variety of factors, including context, culture, and individual differences.

Therefore, the results from the API should be interpreted as a measure of how a person's expressions are likely to be perceived by others, rather than as a definitive statement about what they are feeling.
