# OpenAI API Pricing Tiers

OpenAI offers different pricing tiers to accommodate various needs, trading off between speed, reliability, and cost.

## 1. Standard Tier (Default)

This is the default option for API calls.

- **Speed & Latency:** Fairly quick, suitable for most user-facing applications.
- **Reliability:** Stable and predictable.
- **Cost:** Full published price.
- **Best Use Cases:** Customer-facing chatbots, edtech apps, healthcare assistants.

## 2. Batch API (Slow but Super Cheap)

The Batch API is for processing large volumes of requests asynchronously.

- **Speed & Latency:** Very slow, with results taking minutes to hours (up to 24 hours).
- **Reliability:** Reliable once processed, but not real-time.
- **Cost:** Around 50% cheaper than the Standard tier.
- **Best Use Cases:** Summarizing large datasets, analyzing documents, pre-generating training data.

## 3. Flex Processing (Budget-Friendly)

Flex is a cheaper, slower version of the Standard tier.

- **Speed & Latency:** Variable, with potential delays and "resource unavailable" (429) errors during peak times.
- **Reliability:** Less predictable than the Standard tier.
- **Cost:** About 50% cheaper than the Standard tier for supported models.
- **Best Use Cases:** Background tasks, testing, prototyping, student projects.

## 4. Priority Processing (Premium)

This is the enterprise tier for mission-critical applications.

- **Speed & Latency:** Fastest and most consistent, even during heavy global traffic.
- **Reliability:** Backed by a Service Level Agreement (SLA) with guarantees on uptime and response time.
- **Cost:** More expensive than the Standard tier.
- **Best Use Cases:** Large-scale customer support systems, financial apps, enterprise SaaS platforms.

## Side-by-Side Comparison

| Tier | Speed & Latency | Cost vs Standard | Reliability | Best For |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Batch | Very slow (hours) | ~50% cheaper | Reliable, not real-time | Bulk/offline jobs |
| Flex | Variable, slower | ~50% cheaper | Less predictable | Experiments, background tasks |
| Standard | Stable, moderate speed | Base price | Predictable | User-facing apps |
| Priority | Fastest, SLA-backed | More expensive | Enterprise-grade | Mission-critical apps |
