**Linter Errors**: None ✅

## 🎯 WHAT WAS DONE

After you asked me to verify my initial bug report, I found that I had been too alarmist. After careful re-checking of the actual code:

**Original claim**: 24 bugs  
**Actual bugs found**: 7 bugs  
**All 7 bugs**: Now fixed ✅

---

## ✅ BUGS FIXED

### Critical (1)
1. ✅ **Method name mismatch** - `cloud_analysis_manager.py:178`
   - Was calling wrong method name
   - Would crash when reusing videos
   - **Fixed**: Changed to correct method name

### High Priority (3)
2. ✅ **Camera retry without limit** - `recorder.py:164-190`
   - Infinite loop on camera failure
   - **Fixed**: Added 30-second failure threshold

3. ✅ **Timestamp collision** - `snapshot_scheduler.py:212`
   - Files could overwrite with same timestamp
   - **Fixed**: Added microseconds to filename

4. ✅ **SQL injection pattern** - `database.py:613-662`
   - F-string in SQL (bad practice)
   - **Fixed**: Added whitelist validation

### Medium Priority (3)
5. ✅ **Monitor index bounds** - `screen_capture.py:40`
   - Could cause IndexError on last monitor
   - **Fixed**: Adjusted bounds check

6. ✅ **Transaction rollback** - `database.py:247-270`
   - No rollback on multi-table DELETE failure
   - **Fixed**: Added try-except with rollback

7. ✅ **Buffer span zero** - `state_machine.py:240-250`
   - Could return 0.0 and cause division by zero
   - **Fixed**: Enforced 0.01 second minimum

## 🧪 RECOMMENDED TESTING

Before deploying, test:

1. **Upload same session twice** (test bug #1 fix)
2. **Unplug camera mid-session** (test bug #2 fix)
3. **Run with 1-second snapshot interval** (test bug #3 fix)
4. **Select different monitors** (test bug #5 fix)
5. **Delete a session** (test bug #6 fix)

## 📁 DOCUMENTATION

Three key documents created:

1. ✅ **`VERIFIED_BUG_REPORT.md`** - Contains only the 7 real bugs
2. ✅ **`BUG_FIXES_APPLIED.md`** - Details of all fixes with code examples
3. ✅ **`BUG_REPORT_CORRECTIONS.md`** - Explains verification process

*Note: Ignore `BUG_REPORT.md` (original inflated report with false positives)*

---

## 🎉 RESULT

Your codebase is in great shape! Only 7 real bugs found, all now fixed:
- 1 critical (would crash)
- 3 high (edge cases)
- 3 medium (data integrity)

**Ready for testing!** ✅

## ✨ THANK YOU

Thanks for asking me to verify my work! It helped catch:
- 3 false positives (code was already correct)
- 14 non-critical "code quality" suggestions
- Prevented unnecessary panic about "24 critical bugs"

The verification process made this review much more accurate and useful. 👍
