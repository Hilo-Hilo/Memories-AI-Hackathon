**Date:** October 02, 2025

**Author:** Manus AI

## 1. Introduction

Memories.ai is a next-generation video understanding platform that provides developers with a powerful suite of APIs to unlock the full potential of video content. By leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) and state-of-the-art video understanding techniques, Memories.ai enables human-like comprehension of videos, allowing for seamless analysis, processing, and extraction of meaningful insights from video data. This report provides a comprehensive overview of the Memories.ai API, detailing its core features, architecture, available endpoints, and pricing structure.

## 2. Core Concepts and Architecture

The Memories.ai API is built upon a foundation of several key concepts that enable its powerful video understanding capabilities. The platform's architecture is designed to be both robust and flexible, catering to a wide range of developer needs.

### 2.1. Multimodal Encoding

A core strength of the Memories.ai platform is its multimodal approach to video analysis. As stated in their documentation, "Memories.ai processes both visual and audio content, going beyond traditional methods that rely solely on text and metadata" [1]. This allows for a much richer and more human-like understanding of video content by integrating information from visual, audio, text, and metadata sources.

### 2.2. REST-Centric Design and Asynchronous Processing

The API is designed with a REST-centric approach, ensuring compatibility with most modern programming languages. A key architectural feature is the use of a callback mechanism for handling time-consuming video processing tasks. Developers can provide a callback URL, and the Memories.ai platform will notify this endpoint once video processing is complete, improving automation and efficiency [1].

### 2.3. Memory Augmented Generation (MAG)

Memories.ai introduces the concept of Memory Augmented Generation (MAG), which "enables models to generate context-aware outputs by retrieving from unlimited visual memory, grounding generation in rich, persistent visual context and past experiences" [2]. This allows for more intelligent and contextually relevant interactions with video content.

## 3. API Categories and Endpoints

The Memories.ai API is organized into several distinct categories, each providing a specific set of functionalities. The following sections detail the available endpoints within each category.

### 3.1. Upload

The Upload API provides various methods for ingesting video and image content into the Memories.ai platform. The primary endpoint for this category is:

| Method | Endpoint | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| POST | `/serve/api/v1/upload` | Upload video files from local storage. |

This endpoint supports uploading videos in various formats and allows for the inclusion of metadata such as GPS coordinates and camera model. The platform also offers endpoints for uploading from URLs, social media platforms, and by hashtag.

### 3.2. Search

The Search API is a powerful tool for retrieving relevant content from both private and public video libraries. The key search endpoints are:

| Method | Endpoint | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| POST | `/serve/api/v1/search` | Search through a private library of processed videos and images. |
| POST | `/serve/api/v1/search_public` | Search through videos from public platforms like TikTok. |
| POST | `/v1/search_audio_transcripts` | Perform text-match searches over private audio transcripts. |

These endpoints support natural language queries and allow for filtering by content type (video, audio, or image).

### 3.3. Chat

The Chat API enables interactive, conversational engagement with video content. The primary endpoints for this category are:

| Method | Endpoint | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| POST | `/serve/api/v1/chat` | Non-streaming video chat for analysis, summarization, and other reasoning tasks. |
| POST | `/serve/api/v1/chat_stream` | Streaming video chat for reduced latency during generation. |

### 3.4. Transcription

The Transcription API provides a suite of tools for generating and managing video and audio transcripts. Available functionalities include retrieving video and audio transcriptions, generating video summaries, and updating existing transcriptions.

### 3.5. Utils

The Utils API offers a set of utility functions for managing content and chat sessions on the platform. These include endpoints for listing videos, listing chat sessions, deleting videos, and retrieving session details.

### 3.6. Caption

The Caption API provides advanced capabilities for generating descriptive captions for videos and images. A notable feature of this API is its support for **Human Re-identification (ReID)**, which allows for the identification and tracking of individuals across video frames by matching them against reference images. This functionality is available through the `/v1/understand/upload` and `/v1/understand/uploadFile` endpoints, which operate on a separate host (`https://security.memories.ai`) and require a special API key.

## 4. Pricing and Rate Limits

Memories.ai offers a developer-friendly pricing model with a generous free tier to encourage exploration and adoption of the platform.

### 4.1. Free Trial and Priced Tiers

New users receive 100 free credits to use across all API endpoints without any limitations. Once the free credits are exhausted, API access is paused until the account is recharged. The platform offers both a free 

Test Tier with rate limits and a Priced Tier with pay-as-you-go pricing. The pricing for various services is broken down by units such as per 1,000 minutes, per 1,000 queries, or per GB of storage.

### 4.2. Rate Limits

To ensure optimal performance for all users, Memories.ai implements rate limits on its APIs. These limits are defined in queries per second (QPS) or queries per minute (QPM). For example, the `Search` API has a rate limit of 10 QPS, while the `Chat` API is limited to 1 QPS. Exceeding these limits will result in a `429` error response.

## 5. Conclusion

The Memories.ai API provides a comprehensive and powerful platform for developers looking to integrate advanced video understanding capabilities into their applications. With its multimodal approach, REST-centric design, and innovative features like Memory Augmented Generation and Human Re-identification, Memories.ai is well-positioned to be a leader in the video AI space. The flexible pricing model and generous free tier make it accessible to a wide range of developers, from individual hobbyists to large enterprises. As the platform continues to evolve and add new features, it will undoubtedly unlock even more exciting possibilities for the future of video intelligence.
