# AI Beautification - Phase 1 Implementation

## ✅ **Completed Features (Ready for Testing)**

### **1. AI-Generated Session Summaries with GPT-4**
**File**: `src/focus_guardian/ai/summary_generator.py`

#### **What It Does:**
- Generates 4 types of AI summaries for each session:
  - **Executive Summary**: 2-3 sentence overview (warm and encouraging)
  - **Detailed Summary**: Full paragraph with insights
  - **Highlights**: 3-4 bullet points of key moments
  - **Encouragement**: Motivational closing message

#### **How It Works:**
- Uses GPT-4o-mini for cost-effective generation
- Context-aware: Understands task type (coding vs writing vs studying)
- Personalized: Includes user's historical data for comparisons
- Comparative insights: "This session was 12% better than your average!"

#### **Features:**
✅ Task type inference (detects coding, writing, design, etc.)
✅ User history integration for personalized comparisons
✅ Fallback summaries if GPT-4 fails
✅ Performance logging and timing

#### **Cost:**
- ~$0.002 per session summary (4 API calls with gpt-4o-mini)
- Very affordable for the value provided

### **2. Emotion-Aware Messaging**
**File**: `src/focus_guardian/ai/emotion_aware_messaging.py`

#### **What It Does:**
- Adapts all alerts and messages based on detected emotional state
- Different responses for frustrated, tired, bored, anxious, happy users
- Supportive coaching tone that feels human

#### **Emotion States Detected:**
- 😤 **Frustrated**: Gentle, validating messages
- 😴 **Tired**: Suggests energy breaks, doesn't push
- 😑 **Bored**: Energizing, suggests gamification
- 😰 **Anxious**: Calming, reassuring messages
- 😊 **Happy/Calm**: Friendly, direct communication
- 🧠 **Focused**: Encouraging, doesn't interrupt
- 😓 **Stressed**: Decompression suggestions

#### **Example Transformations:**

**Frustrated User:**
```
❌ Old: "Distraction detected. Return to task."

✅ New: "I Notice You're Frustrated 💭

You've been away from 'Backend API' for 3 minutes.

Frustration is completely normal when tackling hard problems! 
Sometimes stepping away helps. If this is a break, great! 🙂

If you got pulled away unintentionally, your work is waiting when you're ready."
```

**Tired User:**
```
✅ "Energy Check ⚡

I see you've moved away from your task.

You seem tired - pushing through fatigue often leads to more distractions. 
Maybe this is your brain telling you it needs a recharge?

A short break or some movement might help more than pushing through."
```

**Bored User:**
```
✅ "Engagement Check 🎯

This task might need a fresh approach. Consider:
• Breaking it into smaller challenges
• Adding a time challenge (gamify it!)
• Taking a quick break and returning with new energy"
```

#### **Features:**
✅ 8 distinct emotional states with tailored messaging
✅ Emotion-aware break suggestions (different activities for different moods)
✅ Session completion messages adapted to emotion
✅ Tone selection system (gentle, encouraging, energizing, calming, etc.)

### **3. Enhanced Status Badges with Auto-Refresh**
**File**: `src/focus_guardian/ui/main_window.py` (multiple sections)

#### **What It Does:**
- Visual status badges with icons and colors
- Auto-refresh PROCESSING jobs every 60 seconds
- Shows "last checked" timestamp
- Automatic retry until job completes

#### **Status Badges:**
- ⏸️ **PENDING** (gray)
- ⬆️ **UPLOADING** (orange)
- 🔄 **PROCESSING** (blue, animated)
- ✅ **COMPLETED** (green)
- ❌ **FAILED** (red)

#### **Auto-Refresh Features:**
✅ Automatically checks PROCESSING jobs every 60 seconds
✅ Shows "last checked: 2m ago" on button
✅ Tooltip indicates auto-refresh is active
✅ Stops auto-refresh when job completes or fails
✅ Continues checking even if user switches tabs

#### **User Benefits:**
- **No more manual clicking!** System checks automatically
- **Clear feedback**: Always know when it was last checked
- **Notification when complete**: Desktop alert (TODO: next phase)
- **Hands-free**: User can do other things while processing

## 🧪 **How to Test**

### **Test 1: AI-Generated Session Summary**
1. Start a session (use the new task history dropdown!)
2. Stop the session after a few minutes
3. Check the session summary dialog
4. **Expected**: Beautiful AI-generated summary with encouragement

### **Test 2: Emotion-Aware Alerts**
1. During a session, trigger a distraction
2. **Expected**: Alert adapts to emotional state (currently unknown, will be fuller with Hume data)

### **Test 3: Auto-Refresh**
1. Upload a session to cloud
2. Go to Reports tab
3. See "🔍 Check Status" button
4. Click it once
5. **Expected**: 
   - Button shows "🔄 Checking..."
   - After check, shows "🔍 Check Status (1s ago)"
   - After 60 seconds, automatically checks again
   - Updates to "🔍 Check Status (1m ago)"
   - Continues until processing completes
